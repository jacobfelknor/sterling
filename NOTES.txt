Objects::
    - Account
        - can either be a true account, or a category
        - accounts are liability/asset accounts
        - categories are expense/income accounts
        - Are set up to have a hierarchical relationship
            - accounts can have parent/child accounts
            - not currently used

    - Transaction
        - a event describing movement in money between accounts.
        - Simply a way to tie multiple ledgers together
        - not directly associated with any account

    - Ledger
        - an entry within a transaction
        - associated with a transaction, as well as the account it describes

    - Keyword
        - a way to group multiple accounts together. For example, one may have a "Fast Food" and a "Restaurants" account/category that they tie together using the "Food" Keyword. Thinking this may replace the hierarchical
        relationship between accounts


Goal::
    - A fully qualified accounting system that tracks where money comes from and where it goes
